# AGENTS.md — Persistent Developer Guidelines & Safeguards

This file defines the high-priority architectural rules, major pitfalls, technical specifications, mathematical foundations, and resolution strategies for the **Sine-Gordon Lab**. It is automatically loaded by the AI Studio build system to prevent recurring regressions during subsequent iterative engineering sessions.

---

## 1. HIERARCHY OF PRIORITIES

When modifying or expanding the Sine-Gordon Lab, always prioritize tasks in the following strict order:

1. **Runtime Stability & Integrity (Highest)**: The application must boot immediately with zero browser console errors.
2. **Strict ESM Browser Resolution**: We use browser-native standard ES Modules (ESM) *without a bundler compilation layer*.
3. **Responsive Visual Polish & Alignment**: Layouts, margins, and canvas sizing must scale fluidly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
4. **Functional Precision (Strict Scope Ceiling)**: Only implement features explicitly requested by the user. Refuse to add unrequested telemetry, system state displays, or generic controls.

---

## 2. THE THREE.JS IMPORTMAP PITFALL (MOST CRITICAL SAVIOR)

### The Pitfall
In modern browser environments, running native ES Modules with `import * as THREE from 'three'` creates a **bare specifier**. If the browser attempts to parse, preload, or load any ES module *before* the importmap is fully compiled and registered, it throws a fatal, unrecoverable TypeError:
> `TypeError: The specifier "three" was a bare specifier, but was not remapped to anything.`

### Why AI Agents Regularly Break This
AI agents are heavily pre-trained on bundler-based pipelines (Vite, Next.js, Webpack) where Node resolves bare specifiers at compile time. During general maintenance—such as reordering tags, updating viewport scales, adding metadata, or doing head cleanups—agents commonly:
* Reorder `<link rel="modulepreload">` tags or ES Module scripts *above* the `<script type="importmap">`.
* Simplify or consolidate `<head>` tags, thinking the importmap is redundant or can be handled by Node.

### Ultimate Rules for importmap
1. **Absolute Peak Placement**: The `<script type="importmap">` **MUST** be the absolute first child of the `<head>` element in `index.html`, before any style link, viewport meta, preloads, or module scripts.
2. **Duplicate Entry Mapping**: Ensure both directory-nested and absolute specifier mappings exist:
   ```json
   "imports": {
     "three": "./vendor/three/three.module.js",
     "three/": "./vendor/three/",
     "three/addons/": "./vendor/three/addons/"
   }
   ```
3. **No Bare Specifier Removals**: Never alter, remove, or comment out the `importmap` from the HTML file.

## 3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS & REFERENCE MANUAL

Exploring the relativistic soliton dynamics of the discrete Sine-Gordon equation on coupled pendulum chains using browser-native ES modules and a zero-dependency full-stack server.

### 3.1 Project Overview and Key Capabilities
The **Sine-Gordon Lab** is an interactive, browser-native 3D physics laboratory implementing a discrete, numerical simulation of the relativistic **Sine-Gordon equation**. By modeling a chain of coupled torsion pendulums with non-linear gravitational restoration, users can observe, manipulate, inject, and export topological and non-topological solitons (Kinks, Antikinks, Breathers) and breathers. 

* **Three Topology Modes**:
  * **Linear**: Standard straight chain with optional periodic boundaries (wrapping).
  * **Circular**: Closed continuous ring.
  * **Lemniscate**: Double-loop structures mapped via specialty curves (Lemniscates of Gerono & Bernoulli) with variable structural twists.
* **Dual-Channel Impulse Injection**: Interactive impulse injection at user-customized spots (Sites A & B) featuring adjustable sharpness, velocity, and polarity. Modes include:
  * **Kink (CW/CCW Rotation)**
  * **Antikink (CCW/CW Rotation)**
  * **Breather (Local Oscillatory Packets)**
  * **Wind (Continuous helical twisting field)**
* **Real-time 3D Rendering & Aesthetics**: Real-time rendering powered by Three.js with custom GLSL shaders, color gamut expansion based on phase speed, and a dark glassmorphism glass dashboard.
* **Professional Export System**:
  * **FFmpeg.wasm Video Assembly**: In-browser video synthesis yielding containerized **WebM** or **MP4** files, configured with crop-to-fit aspect ratio retention and mod-2/mod-4 alignment filters.
  * **Telemetry Snapshot**: Complete spreadsheet-compatible `.json` data dump containing the absolute physical coordinates ($\phi$, $\dot{\phi}$, $\ddot{\phi}$) across every temporal sequence.
  * **Standalone ZIP Capture**: Streamed frame-by-frame static PNG capturing bundled via non-blocking JSZip pipelines requiring minimal memory overhead.

### 3.4 Mathematical Formulations & Physics Engine
The motion of the $i$-th pendulum is governed by the second-order ODE representing the discrete Sine-Gordon equation:

$$ \frac{d^2 \phi_i}{dt^2} = \kappa \left( \phi_{i+1} - 2\phi_i + \phi_{i-1} \right) - \gamma \frac{d\phi_i}{dt} - g \sin(\phi_i) + T_{\text{inertial}} $$

Where:
* **Coupling Term ($\kappa$)**: Represents torsion springs connecting adjacent pendulums. Under periodic topologies, indices wrap such that $i+1 \equiv (i+1) \bmod N$.
* **Damping ($\gamma$)**: Represents local drag forces.
* **Restoring Gravity ($g$)**: Restores pendulums towards the vertical axis of stable equilibrium. If $g < 0$, the pendulum chain flips orientation, centering stable equilibrium at state $\phi = \pi$.

#### Gimbal Inertial Couplings ($T_{\text{inertial}}$)
When the visual nested gimbal rings are activated, the laboratory simulates the physical consequences of moving frames including Coriolis, Centrifugal, and Euler torques:
* **Simplified Mode**: Simulates centrifugal torque generated under continuous steady axial rotation at vertical angular velocity $\Omega_y$:

  $$ T_{\text{centrifugal}} = - \frac{\Omega_y^2}{L} \cos(\phi_i) \left( R_{\text{trans}} - L \sin(\phi_i) \right) $$

* **Full Rigorous Mode**: Translates the full dynamic rotation matrix across coordinate axes. Resolves 3D angular velocities $\vec{\Omega}$ and acceleration vectors $\vec{\dot{\Omega}}$ across local coordinates to determine instantaneous Euler and centrifugal accelerations.

#### Symmetrical Soliton Injection
Kinks are injected by mapping analytical spatial forms onto the discrete array. The phase assignment is defined as:

$$ \phi_i = \phi_i^0 + A \cdot 4 \arctan\left( \exp\left( \frac{x_i - x_0}{W_{\text{eff}}} \right) \right) $$

With conjugate velocities:

$$ \dot{\phi}_i = \dot{\phi}_i^0 \pm v_{\text{launch}} \cdot A \cdot \frac{2}{W_{\text{eff}}} \operatorname{sech}\left( \frac{x_i - x_0}{W_{\text{eff}}} \right) $$

Where:
* $W_{\text{eff}} = \max\left( W_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{\kappa}}, 1.5 \right)$ represents the relativistic Lorentz contraction limit adjusted to prevent sub-lattice pinning (Peierls-Nabarro barrier).
* A small relaxation stage (4 simulation steps using high local damping of $\gamma = 0.3$) is automatically executed post-injection to absorb high-frequency lattice noise.

## 4. CRITICAL PITFALLS, SOLUTIONS, & RESOLVER BLUEPRINTS

### 4.1 Non-Widescreen Aspect Stretching
* **The Pitfall**: Video recordings or canvas outputs being stretched or containing black letterboxes/pillarboxes when resolution defaults to rigid dimensions.
* **The Resolution**: Use standard modulo-2 dimensions (`Math.floor(value / 2) * 2`) instead of modulo-16. Introduce a dynamic crop-to-fit filter in the FFmpeg assembly phase using:
  `scale=W:H:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase,crop=W:H`
  This ensures the exported canvas matches modern standard aspect ratios beautifully without distorting the simulated physics visual grid.

### 4.2 H.264 Macroblock Boundaries & Widescreen Remapping
* **The Pitfall**: Standard 480p is commonly listed as 854x480. However, the number `854` is not divisible by 4 (nor 8 or 16), which triggers H.264 (libx264) macroblock alignment errors or decoders rendering ugly green boundary stripes or crashing entirely on export.
* **The Precision Recipe**: Remap standard resolutions to strictly compliant Mod-8 or Mod-16 boundaries:
  - Remap **854x480** to exact Mod-4 widescreen **852x480** (aspect ratio 1.775:1), which compiles perfectly inside standard H.264 video streams.
  - Employ square pixel output properties (`setsar=1`) and standard Lanczos scale/crop-to-fit parameters inside the filters to prevent canvas pixel distortion.

```js
export const FFMPEG_RESOLUTIONS_RECIPES = {
  "640x360": {
    width: 640,
    height: 360,
    filter: "scale=640:360:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase:flags=lanczos,crop=640:360,setsar=1"
  },
  "854x480": {
    width: 852,
    height: 480,
    filter: "scale=852:480:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase:flags=lanczos,crop=852:480,setsar=1"
  },
  "1280x720": {
    width: 1280,
    height: 720,
    filter: "scale=1280:720:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase:flags=lanczos,crop=1280:720,setsar=1"
  },
  "1920x1080": {
    width: 1920,
    height: 1080,
    filter: "scale=1920:1080:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase:flags=lanczos,crop=1920:1080,setsar=1"
  },
  "2560x1440": {
    width: 2560,
    height: 1440,
    filter: "scale=2560:1440:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase:flags=lanczos,crop=2560:1440,setsar=1"
  },
  "3840x2160": {
    width: 3840,
    height: 2160,
    filter: "scale=3840:2160:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase:flags=lanczos,crop=3840:2160,setsar=1"
  }
};
```

### 4.3 Canvas Context Self-Draw Collision
* **The Pitfall**: Reusing a single temporary canvas for both pixel reading and coordinate vertical inversion (y-flip) causes browser horizontal clipping or blank frame compilation.
* **The Resolution**: Keep separate source and destination canvas buffers in GPU storage. Draw the active WebGL canvas raw frames onto a `_rawCanvas` (for pristine pixel capture with no interface scaling or thread blocking), and project it onto the destination context inversion matrix cleanly.

### 4.4 Multi-threaded FFmpeg.wasm Re-entry Crash & RAM Saturation (Unified OPFS Architecture)
* **The Pitfall**: Capturing high-resolution canvas frames at 60fps easily saturates RAM inside the browser tab, leading to abrupt page crashes (OOM errors) or memory leaks. Furthermore, passing raw references of `Uint8Array` byte buffers directly to FFmpeg memory transfers can detach arrays or freeze multi-threaded background workers, crashing sequential assemblies. Additionally, writing hundreds of high-resolution (e.g. 1440p or 4K) raw uncompressed frames to MEMFS and running single-pass assembly easily exceeds the 2GB WebAssembly heap restriction, triggering instant VM crashes.
* **The Resolution (Unified Safe Stream & Dynamic Bounds)**:
  1. **Unified OPFS Storage Loop**: Both the "direct" video-rendering (MP4/WebM) and standard "ZIP export" pipelines use the exact same file-streaming model. Rather than holding huge frame arrays in main RAM, frames are written immediately to a temporary sub-directory via the high-speed, sandboxed **Origin Private File System (OPFS)** (`navigator.storage.getDirectory()`).
  2. **Zero-leak Lifetime Management**: When FFmpeg assembly completes or is aborted, the temporary directory is recursively deleted (`root.removeEntry(tempDir, { recursive: true })`) to completely eliminate storage waste.
  3. **Resolution-Aware Pipeline Router (`shouldUseChunkedAssembly`)**: Instead of a hardcoded 1500-frame threshold for all videos, the system evaluates the frame pixel overhead. If the resolution is extremely high, we route to the chunked memory-safe pipeline much sooner to protect the WASM heap:
     - **4K (3840x2160)**: Chunked assembly is triggered if the recording exceeds **30 frames**.
     - **1440p (2560x1440)**: Chunked assembly is triggered if the recording exceeds **60 frames**.
     - **1080p (1920x1080)**: Chunked assembly is triggered if the recording exceeds **120 frames**.
     - **720p and below**: Uses the default **1500 frames** threshold.
  4. **Dynamic Chunk Size Boundaries**: In the chunked assembly phase, `CHUNK_SIZE` scales dynamically based on the rendering resolution to keep peak allocations under ~150MB of heap:
     - **4K**: `CHUNK_SIZE = 40` frames
     - **1440p**: `CHUNK_SIZE = 75` frames
     - **1080p**: `CHUNK_SIZE = 100` frames
     - **720p and below**: `CHUNK_SIZE = 150` frames
  5. **Low-Weight Processing Profiles**: To avoid CPU bottlenecks that crash browser worker threads, WebM (VP8) videos are built with the high-speed `-deadline realtime` profile and `-cpu-used 4/5` flags. MP4 (H.264) videos rendered in high density (1440p/4K) automatically swap the heavy default preset for `-preset veryfast` to maintain pristine performance on a single-threaded WebAssembly execution.

### 4.5 Persistent Save/Open Directories (Chromium Native ID Association)
* **The Pitfall**: In web apps with rich export and offline assembly workflows, every time a user triggers a ZIP save or wants to open/upload a zip file, standard browser fallbacks force the local system's directory dialogue to reset to the computer's generic default directory (such as `/Downloads` or `/Documents`). This breaks continuity during laboratory sessions where users export sequentially or load files from a designated project workspace.
* **The Resolution (Shared Native Browser Picker IDs)**:
  1. **Strictly Shared Identifiers**: We assign the exact same `id: 'zip-export'` parameter across all invocations of `showSaveFilePicker` and `showOpenFilePicker`.
  2. **Native Path Tracking**: Chromium-based browsers recognize matching IDs and natively anchor the active file prompts (whether saving or opening) back into the user's exact host folder (e.g., standard Windows File Explorer or macOS Finder directories) from the previous action. This guarantees elegant, zero-overhead offline continuity without complex security exceptions:
     ```js
     const pickerOpts = {
       id: 'zip-export',
       types: [{ description: 'ZIP Files', accept: { 'application/zip': ['.zip'] } }]
     };
     const handle = await window.showSaveFilePicker(pickerOpts);
     ```

### 4.6 Direct ZIP Assembly Layout Alignment (Jitter-Free Stacking)
* **The Pitfall**: Coupling export, record, and offline assembly actions specifically to the `zip` pipeline selection option can cause layout shifting, dropdown misalignment, or sudden element jumps if the action dropdown is toggled with aggressive display layout changes.
* **The Resolution (Jitter-Free Visibility & Stacked Alignment Control)**:
  1. **Clean Stacked Hierarchy**: In the UI, structure the main export pipeline format dropdown (FFmpeg, OPFS, ZIP) directly on top, and place the Record/Assemble action dropdown directly below it.
  2. **Jitter-Free State Toggles**: Symmetrically manage the action select dropdown state with `visibility: hidden; pointer-events: none` when non-zip pipelines are active. This retains the exact spatial dimensions and prevents components from jumping or popping vertically.
  3. **Secure Action Binding**: Symmetrically disable user controls and update state indicators (`isAssembling: true`) when assembly or extraction pipelines are busy, locking potential state conflicts.

### 4.7 Over-Engineering, Tech-Larping, & "AI-Slop"
* **The Pitfall**: Adding unrequested technical decorations (e.g., "CORE_NODE_ONLINE", "PORT: 3000", custom grid coordinates) to make the simulation look more "complex."
* **The Resolution**: Keep labels literal, human, and modest. If the user asks for a simple mathematical control, implement ONLY that control cleanly, utilizing generous white space and high-contrast styling.

---

## 5. VERIFICATION WORKFLOW
Before declaring any task complete, always execute these checks sequentially:
1. **Linter Check**: Run the CLI linter to verify syntax: `npm run lint`.
2. **Production Compilation Check**: Test compilation: `npm run build` or `compile_applet`.
3. **Browser Parse Verification**: Check that `<script type="importmap">` rests untouched at the peak of `<head>`.
